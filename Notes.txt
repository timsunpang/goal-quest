How to update the equipped items
- Each item, in addition to having a type as armor, needs an armor type
- When you click on an item in the equipment page, it will
  update the user for that particular item's armor type with the
  armor's ID

item - onClick = {handleEquipmentClick}

handleEquipmentClick:
  - if item is armor
    - User is not currently wearing armor
      - ApiUtil.changeArmor({item.armor_type: item.id})
      - ApiUtil makes PATCH request to User
    - User is wearing armor
      - ApiUtil.changeArmor({item.armor_type: defaults}) via PATCH
  - else
    - nothing for now
    - (add HP value to HP)


Problem - we have no easy way of seeing if the user is wearing the item or not, from the
item's perspective

Additionally - we need to find a way to change the user's equipped items, although
the user's item column is called head_id, body_id, etc. while our item's armor_type
is called head, body, etc.
